Jiggle mouse

Pretends to be a USB mouse and moves the cursor a tiny bit every 1 to 2 minutes, hence "jiggle".

Tested on:
* Raspberry Pi Pico: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/
* Adafruit Trinkey RP2040 QT: https://www.adafruit.com/product/5056

Compiles with vanilla pico-sdk.
Don't forget to submodule-init!
